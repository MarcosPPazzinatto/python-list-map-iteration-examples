# Python Iteration Examples

This repository provides clear and practical examples of how to work with iteration in Python.  
It focuses on lists, the built-in `map` function, and different iteration styles such as `foreach` and traditional `for(i)` loops.

## Contents
- **Lists**: creation, slicing, list comprehensions, and common operations.
- **Map, Filter, Reduce**: functional-style iteration using Python built-ins.
- **Iteration**: using `for-in` (similar to Java foreach) and index-based loops (`for(i)` style).
- **Iterators and Generators**: understanding how iteration works under the hood.

## Goals
- Demonstrate Python iteration with simple and advanced examples.
- Show similarities and differences compared to Java constructs (e.g., `stream().map()` vs. Python `map()`).
- Provide a learning resource for developers coming from Java or other languages.

## How to Use
Clone the repository and run any file with Python 3:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-iteration-examples.git
cd python-iteration-examples
python3 lists/basic_lists.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
